- 👻 **BOO**, I'm Stephanie.  

- 🧸 I graduated from [Otis College](https://www.otis.edu/programs/undergraduate/bfa-toy-design/index.html) in 2025, where I majored in Toy.  While there, I wrote a [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hIC_CobNBcgrOpdmZ8-biVrBif1hAXR/view) about code, curves, and creativity.
- 💠 I've also done geometry research with [IU Bloomington](https://math.indiana.edu/undergraduate/reu-summer-research-program/past-reu/2024/index.html) and [MIT](https://sgi.mit.edu/).  I hope to learn more geometry (and algebra) in the future.
- ⭐️ One time I developed and taught a workshop about group theory and origami toys.  This fall, I"m mentoring with [National Math Stars](https://nationalmathstars.org/).
- 🥰 My favorite toy is my octocat plushie Mona.
