- 👻 **BOO**, I'm Stephanie.  

- 🧸 I graduated from [Otis College] (https://www.otis.edu/programs/undergraduate/bfa-toy-design/index.html) in 2025, where I majored in Toy.  While there, I wrote a thesis about code, curves, and creativity.
- 💠 I've also done geometry research with IU Bloomington and MIT.  I hope to learn more geometry (and algebra) in the future.
- ⭐️ One time I developed and taught a workshop about group theory and origami toys.  This fall, I am mentoring with National Math Stars.
- 🥰 My favorite toy is my octocat plushie Mona.
