- 👋 Salutions!  I’m @ToyTeX (aka stephanie)
- 👀 I’m interested in discrete math research, creative coding, and computational design.
- 🌱 I’m currently cultivating my skills in Python, JS, and various backend tech.  Interested in learning how to write a decent proof.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any pure (discrete or continuous) computational math projects or quirky coding enterprises.
