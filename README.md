- 👻 BOO, I'm Stephanie.  

- 🧸 I graduated with a bachelor's in Toy Design from Otis College in 2025, where I wrote a thesis about code, curves, and creativity.
- 💠 I've also done geometry research with IU Bloomington and MIT.  I hope to learn more geometry (and algebra) in the future.
- ⭐️ One time I designed and taught a workshop about group theory and origami toys.  This fall, I will be mentoring with National Math Stars.
- 🥰 My favorite toy is my octocat plushie Mona.
